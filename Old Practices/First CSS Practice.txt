<!-- css: 1: change color of text to individual element but there are better ways
to apply css style. 2: We can also create a class of style that are reusable
in every element by for example: assign color to .red-text. 3: We can also
change font-size and assign font-family to any element within element selector
(style). 4:when the image surrounded by border we can round corner using
border-radius. 5: border radius = 50% create a circular image inside
the border. 6: use background-color to set it in any element. 7: can also get
background color from url -->

<!-- we can set an id to any single element that we can want to style individually. 
  Remember id must be unique to individual element. when id and class is conflicted
id will win. In element selector begin with # to style an id instead of . that we 
normally use with class -->
