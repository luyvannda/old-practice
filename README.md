# practice

This is the first readme I have ever created on github.

Hi my name is Luy Vannda. You can call me Joe Joe. I am from Cambodia and I am now learning to code.
I want to become a fullstack web developper. Thank you for reading my introduction. Feel free to add
me as your friends on github. Happy coding, guys!!! 

------How to use Git/Github for web development teamwork: A basic exercise--------
Simply follow the instructions in this brief manual.

Before we begin, choose one teammate to be Student A, and another to be Student B. If you've already completed steps 1-3 feel free to skip them. Once you're ready, just follow these steps in order:

Both A and B: Create an account on https://github.com/.
Both A and B: Download and install git. Windows users can use https://gitforwindows.org/. Linux users can use sudo apt-get install git instead.
Both A and B: Download and install Visual Studio Code from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download. This may take some time, so be patient.
Student A: Create a new github repository. If you've never done this before, google How to create a new github repository.
Student A: Add student B as a collaborator to your newly created repository. Again: use google here if you are unfamiliar with this process.
Student B: You should receive an e-mail with an invitation to become a collaborator. Open it, and accept the invitation on GitHub.
Both A and B: Clone the repository using the git clone command in terminal you installed on step 2.
Both A and B: Once you've cloned the repo folder on your terminal, use the cd your-repo-name command to navigate into the repository folder. Just replace your-repo-name with the name you used to create the repository on github.
Both A and B: Use the pwd command to display the path where the project was saved in your computer.
Both A and B: Open the repo folder from that path in Visual Studio Code.
Student A: Add a file to the project named index.html with the content Hello, World! and save it.
Student A: Check git status command.
Student A: Back at your git terminal, enter the git add . command.
Student A: Check git status command again. Observe changes in the output.
Student A: Enter the git commit -m "First commit" command.
Student A: Enter the git log command. Your last commit should be on the list.
Student A: Enter the git push command. Enter your GitHub credentials if the terminal requires them.
Both A and B: Check the github.com page of the repo and note how the index.html file was added there.
Student B: Using your git terminal, enter the git pull command. This should add the index.html file created by A to your local clone of the project.
Student B: Enter the git log command. The last commit pulled from GitHub should be on the list.
Student B: Open the project on Visual Studio Code.
Student B: Add the line How are you? to index.html.
Student B: Just like A did before, use git add ., git commit -m "Updated index", git push:
Note how your commit is added to history by checking the output git log command.
Note how the changes are added to the GitHub page.
Student A: Use git pull to apply the changes on your local clone.
Congratulations! Now you know how to collaborate together on a web development project!

Now use your new programming skills to move forward with the HTML/CSS project.

Cheers and Happy Coding :)!
