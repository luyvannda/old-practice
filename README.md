# practice

This is the first readme I have ever created on github.

Hi my name is Luy Vannda. You can call me Joe Joe. I am from Cambodia and I am now learning to code in freeCodeCamp and the Odin Projects.

I want to become a fullstack web developper. Thank you for reading my introduction. Feel free to add me as your friends on github. Happy coding, guys!!! 

Note: This repo is for my own personal practice purposes and so its contents will be added, removed, and replaced as many times as necessary depend on my progress as web developper student. Check my other repos if you want to see project based contents with no content fluctuations. Thank you!!!
